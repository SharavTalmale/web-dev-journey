# **GitHub**

Setup SSH key using chat-gpt or following steps.

1. **Generate a new SSH key**
    
    To generate a new SSH key, open the terminal and run the following command:
    
    **Terminal window**
    
    `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@chaicode.com"`
    
    Here ed25519 is the type of key that you are generating. This creates a new SSH key, using the provided email as label.
    
2. **Save the key**
    
    After generating the key, you need to save it to your computer. You can do this by running the following command:
    
    > Enter a file in which to save the key¬†(/Users/YOU/.ssh/id_ALGORITHM): [Press enter]
    > 
    
    At the prompt you can enter passphrase for the key or you can leave it blank. If you leave it blank, the key will be saved without a passphrase.
    
3. **Add key to your ssh-agent**
    
    After saving the key, you need to add it to your ssh-agent. You can do this by running the following command:
    
    Here it is best to refer above link for more information, as Github has a lot of information on this. There is no point in repeating it here.
    
4. **Add key to github**
    
    Use the web ui to add the key to your github account. You can do this by following the instructions on the¬†[Github website](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account?tool=webui).
